iscsitarget (1.4.20.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The following conf file have changed locations from /etc/ to /etc/iet/
  * /etc/ietd.conf => /etc/iet/ietd.conf
  * /etc/initiators.allow => /etc/iet/initiators.allow

  initiators.deny file has been deprecated upstream and thus will not be
  shipped going forward. The old file, if present will still be used.

  targets.allow file has been added, where different networks/ranges can be
  specified for individual targets.
