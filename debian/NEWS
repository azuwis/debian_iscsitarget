iscsitarget (1.4.20.3+svn490-1) experimental; urgency=low

  With this upload, the iscsitarget package will be targetted from the
  upstream "trunk" development branch. iscsitarget has not see a stable
  release in the last 2 years and most of the active changes (usually
  the kernel fixes) take place in the trunk branch.

  If you want to stick with the "stable branch, please stick to the
  Debian Wheezy release

iscsitarget (1.4.20.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The following conf file have changed locations from /etc/ to /etc/iet/
  * /etc/ietd.conf => /etc/iet/ietd.conf
  * /etc/initiators.allow => /etc/iet/initiators.allow

  initiators.deny file has been deprecated upstream and thus will not be
  shipped going forward. The old file, if present will still be used.

  targets.allow file has been added, where different networks/ranges can be
  specified for individual targets.
